## General definition of the Tree in the data structure
A **tree** is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.

Other data structures such as arrays, linked list, stack, and queue are linear data structures that store data sequentially. In order to perform any operation in a linear data structure, the time complexity increases with the increase in the data size. But, it is not acceptable in today's computational world.

Different tree data structures allow quicker and easier access to the data as it is a non-linear data structure.

## Important properties of Tree

There are many properties of Tree structure. The most important among them are **Height of tree**, **Depth** and **Level of Tree**.

> Depth –The depth of a node is the number of edges from the node to the tree's root node.

> Level – The level of a node is defined by 1 + the number of connections between the node and the root.

> Height of tree –The height of a tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

Also, there are another important properties such as **Edge**, **Path** and **Height of node**.

> Edge – connection between one node to another.

> Path – a sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant.

> Height of node – The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest downward path between that node and a leaf.
