# Stack

## General definition of the Stack in the data structure

It is a simple data structure that allows adding and removing elements 
in a particular order. Every time an element is added, it goes on the top 
of the stack and the only element that can be removed is the element that 
is at the top of the stack, just like a pile of objects.

The stack follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. 
If you are folding books, the top book is taken in front of the 
bottom one. Or, when you browse the Internet, the Back button 
takes you to the last page you viewed.

The stack has the following common methods:

    push(): enter a new element
    pop(): remove the top item, return the removed item
    peek(): return the top item
    length(): return the number of elements on the stack
